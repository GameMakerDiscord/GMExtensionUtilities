# gmx-utils

This repository contains the source code for a Command-Line Interface that can be used along side Gamemaker Studio 2 to automatically truncate project scripts, manage, and manipulate extension data. This is useful for large packages where it would be a waste of time to manually update extension information for every script after every unique build.

## Building
Requires Visual Studio with Visual Basic to compile. Simply [download the zip](https://github.com/GameMakerDiscord/gmx-utils/archive/master.zip), or clone the repository with 
```
git clone git@github.com:GameMakerDiscord/gmx-utils.git
```

## Release
Download the pre-built executables from https://github.com/GameMakerDiscord/gmx-utils/releases. (`gmx-utils.zip`)

## Installation
Once you have the executable, there is no more required installation. Simply run the executable from the command line.

## Dependencies
Newtonsoft JSON v12.0.2
